# Golden reference frames
# Place known-good BMP captures here (e.g. frame_0030.bmp, frame_0060.bmp).
# CI will compare captured frames against these references using RMSE.
# When no reference exists for a frame, CI will auto-save the current
# frame as the new reference (if rendering is non-black).
