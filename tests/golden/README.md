# Golden reference frames
# Place known-good BMP captures here (e.g. frame_0030.bmp, frame_0060.bmp).
# CI will compare captured frames against these references using RMSE.
# CI does not automatically create or update golden reference frames.
# To create or update references, run tools/verify_port.py --update-golden
# locally and commit the resulting BMP files to this directory.
